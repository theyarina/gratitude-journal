# Gratitude Journal App

A simple, elegant web app to help users practice daily gratitude, build connections, and track progress toward their goals. Built in under an hour using AI-powered tools like v0.dev, this project showcases the power of rapid app development with modern no-code solutions.

## 📖 About the Project
The Gratitude Journal app allows users to reflect daily by entering:
- **3 things they’re grateful for** to foster positivity.
- **3 people they’ll connect with** to strengthen relationships.
- **3 actions toward their goals** to stay focused and productive.

It also features an archive view with a calendar picker to revisit past entries, styled with a warm ombre gradient (brown, orange, beige, gold) for an elegant, unisex aesthetic. This app was created as part of an AI content series to demonstrate how AI tools can solve real problems with speed and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

🎥 How It Was Built
This app was created in under an hour as part of an AI content series. Using v0.dev, I generated the app with a single prompt, deployed it to Vercel, and pushed the code to GitHub. The process demonstrates how AI can accelerate app development while maintaining quality and functionality. Check out the reel for a behind-the-scenes look! (Link to your reel once it’s ready.)
